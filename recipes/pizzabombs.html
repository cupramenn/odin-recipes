            <li>1 (16 oz) can refrigerated bisquits</li>
            <li>1/2 c. marinara sauce, <em>or as needed</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, <em>or as needed</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup pepperoni, <em>or as needed</em></li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, <em>or to taste</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heads p">Directions</h2>

            <ol class="text">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Pop open the biscuit can and divide into 8 biscuits. 
                    Flatten each biscuit with your thumb into a 1/8-inch thick circle.</li>
                <li>Spread the center of each circle with about 1 tablespoon marinara sauce, 
                    leaving a 1/4-inch edge open. Sprinkle each circle with about 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, 
                    and about 1 tablespoon pepperoni.</li>
                <li>Pull up the edges of each circle to form a ball, and seal completely. 
                    Roll them in your hands to ensure the dough is sealed, then set each ball on the baking sheet seal-side-down.</li>
                <li>Brush each ball with melted butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. 
                    Serve with additional warmed marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
