            <p>These top-rated fish tacos are topped with a homemade sauce and fresh cabbage. 
                You can also add sliced avocados, onions, 
                cotija cheese, and/or diced tomatoes. 
                Really, you can use whatever toppings you like! 
                The sky’s the limit. 
            </p>
            <p>We love cod filets for fish tacos because it’s mild and is unlikely to fall apart during the frying process. 
                Other great options include tilapia, halibut, grouper, mahi mahi, or sea bass. 
                Any white fish will work well for this recipe.
